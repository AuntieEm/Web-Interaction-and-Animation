		<h1>First Canvas Example</h1>
		<p>This document contains our first canvas example</p>
        
        <canvas id="Canvas1" width="400" height="300">
        	Your browser does not support canvas.
        </canvas>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Drawing Lines In Canvas</h1>
		<p>This example will draw several styles of lines. First: basic line width</p>
		<canvas id="Canvas2" width="500" height="200">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>

		<canvas id="Canvas7" width="700" height="300">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Drawing Bezier and Quadratic Curves</h1>
		<p>This example will draw bezier and quadratic curves, along with their control points 
		so you can see how the curve is affected by the control point.</p>
		<canvas id="Canvas8" width="700" height="300">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Drawing Text</h1>
		<p>This example will render text on the canvas</p>
		<canvas id="Canvas9" width="700" height="300">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Drawing Shadows</h1>
		<p>All drawing operations can produce shadows. This example shows how to make shadows on a variety of canvas operations.</p>
		<canvas id="Canvas10" width="700" height="300">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Drawing Patterns</h1>
		<p>Patterns can be created from images, videos, or even other canvas elements.</p>
		<canvas id="Canvas11" width="700" height="300">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>
		<canvas id="patCan" width="25" height="25"></canvas>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Drawing Gradients</h1>
		<p>The HTML5 Canvas supports two kinds of gradients - linear and radial.</p>
		<canvas id="Canvas12" width="700" height="300">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Drawing Images</h1>
		<p>Images can be drawn directly onto a canvas element in a variety of ways. Your code can drawn an image
		directly from an IMG or VIDEO element that is already in the page or loaded dynamically via script, or 
		another canvas element can be used as a source image.</p>
		<canvas id="Canvas13" width="500" height="650">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>
		
		<!-- source images used in this example -->
		<img id="img1" src="images/stop-sign.jpg" width="477" height="600" style="display:none;">
		<video id="vid1" src="video/video.mp4" loop style="display:none"></video>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Clipping Paths</h1>
		<p>Clipping paths restrict drawing to a particular area of the canvas. Think of clipping paths as masks - 
        areas where the mask is empty show through, while areas where the mask is opaque do not.</p>
        <p>Any path can be a clipping path. You simply draw the path as normal and then call the context's clip() 
        function to create one.</p>
		<canvas id="Canvas14" width="800" height="600">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>
		<img id="img2" src="images/train.jpg" width="800" height="600" style="display:none;">
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Clipping Paths 2</h1>
		<p>Clipping paths restrict drawing to a particular area of the canvas. Think of clipping paths as masks - 
        areas where the mask is empty show through, while areas where the mask is opaque do not.</p>
        <p>Any path can be a clipping path. You simply draw the path as normal and then call the context's clip() 
        function to create one.</p>
		<canvas id="Canvas15" width="700" height="300">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>The Translate Transform</h1>
		<p>The translate transform simply repositions the origin of the canvas. In this demo, a rectangle is drawn at the default origin of 0,0. A second
		rectangle is drawn at 0,0 after the translate transform has been applied.</p>
		<canvas id="Canvas16" width="700" height="300">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>The Scale Transform</h1>
		<p>The scale transform causes drawing operations to be multiplied by the given scale multiples. Here, a rectangle is drawn,
		then a scale transform is applied, and the same rectangle is drawn again (but offset so the difference can be seen). Even though
		they are drawn with the same width and height, the scale transform causes the second rectangle to be drawn larger.</p>
		<canvas id="Canvas17" width="700" height="300">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>The Rotate Transform</h1>
		<p>.</p>
		<canvas id="Canvas18" width="700" height="300">Your browser does not support canvas.</canvas>
        
        
        
        
        <h1>Drawing with the Global Alpha</h1>
		<p>The canvas' globalAlpha setting allows you to set the opacity level of all objects drawn on the canvas at once. In
		This example, the globalAlpha is gradually reduced from 1.0 (the default) down to 0.1.</p>

        <h1>The Canvas Compositing Methods</h1>
		<p>This demo shows how each of the compositing methods affects how drawing operations are made to the canvas.</p>
